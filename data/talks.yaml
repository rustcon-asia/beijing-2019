"Making Rust Delightful":
  speaker: Nick Cameron
  headshot: nick.jpg
  abstract: |
    Rust strives to be an ergonomic language: easy to read, easy to write, and easy to maintain. We want it to be a language which delights! But what does that mean? How do the language and library designers decide what makes a feature ergonomic? And how do we consider the trade-offs between ergonomics and other design pressures such as safety and performance?

    I'll cover Rust's design philosophy, some case studies on ergonomics from the language, libraries, and tools, and talk about how design decisions are made by the language team and others. I'll talk about issues such as 'explicit vs implicit', syntactic sugar, and consistency.

"Linux From Scratch in Rust":
  speaker: Mingshen Sun
  headshot: mingshen.jpg
  abstract: |
    Rust's memory-safety and zero-abstraction makes it the best candidate for system programming. To provide a safe execution environment, we build a Linux distribution from scratch in Rust including a building system, user-space utilities, and a simple package management system. In this talk, we mainly focus on our user-space toolbox, which is a collection of core system utilities. We will discuss some design challenges and problems we encountered in building the toolbox, e.g., handling standard I/O, dynamic dispatching vs static generic type, testing and coverage issues, etc.

"Rust for competitive programming":
  speaker: bhuztez
  headshot: bhueztez.png
  abstract: |
    Competitive programming requires you to solve problems efficiently and correctly in a very short time. Since there is not a single library that designed for competitive programming, contenders often have to implement non-trivial data-structures and algorithms from scratch which tedious and error-prone. This talk is about why Rust is a good fit for making libraries for competitive programming and how.

"How Rust taught me to think about systems":
  speaker: Ravi Shankar
  headshot: ravi.jpg
  abstract: |
    All Rustaceans know that Rust's borrow checker is merciless to newcomers. This talk covers the pain points encountered by me, back when I was a newcomer to Rust (and systems, in general). We'll see a variety of situations which are totally normal in a number of high-level languages but not in Rust, how the same code differed in Rust, how the errors made sense after a while, and how that changed me to think about approaching problems from there on. If you're looking for motivation to get into Rust, or if it made you angry or scared you away at some point, then this talk is for you!

"Cargo meets Autotools":
  speaker: Yiming Jing
  headshot: yiming.jpg
  abstract: |
    Since 1.10, rustc can generate a dynamic library that is intended to be used from C or C FFI, as long as the cdylib crate type is specified in Cargo.toml. While the cargo install command makes it a breeze to distribute executables (e.g. ripgrep), it does NOT work with cdylib dynamic libraries.

    Back in 2018 we had struggled a long way to get a working build infrastructure, just to build and distribute our dynamic library written in Rust. Eventually, we made autotools work happily together with the rust toolchain. Now a user can just download our source tarball, uncompress, and run ./configure && make && make install, just like old times. In this talk we'd like to share our story and hopefully this will be useful for the community.

Then we assist the audience with hands-on experiments on Rust+SGX and Rust+Trustzone platforms. At last, we'll discuss about the internals and ecosystems.

"Thinking In Rust":
  speaker: Nick Cameron
  headshot: nick.jpg
  abstract: |    
    Learning a new programming language is hard. Even after mastering the syntax and type system, learning the libraries and techniques can take years. If you've read or written Rust and want to improve, this talk will give you a turbo boost! This will be a very practical tutorial, aimed at taking your Rust programming to the next level. We'll teach some core Rust design principles by covering a few key topics in depth.

    The tutorial will start with programming 'in the small': we'll explore some key library types (Option, Result, and Iterator) and cover practical error handling. Putting these together we'll see how to structure your control flow to write clear, succinct programs. We'll then cover some larger-scale design issues - using ownership
    as a primary architectural principle, and abstraction using traits.

    You'll learn how to be more productive in Rust by writing clean and idiomatic code. You'll learn to work with the language rather than fighting against it.

"Build a Decentralized app on Blockstack Chain V2":
  speaker: Su Bo
  headshot: subo.jpg
  abstract: |
    Blockstack is a full-stack decentralized computing network that enables a new generation of applications where developers and users can interact fairly and securely while curing the ills of centralized Internet design. Blockstack builds protocols and developer tools designed to enable a fair and open Internet that returns digital rights to developers and consumers. Led by some of the world’s foremost experts on distributed systems, Blockstack allows users to own their own data that they can take with them from app to app in the ecosystem, along with their Blockstack ID that eliminates the need for password-based logins. The end result is privacy, security, and freedom.

    Stacks blockchain v2 is planned for late 2019 and will introduce two big changes/features.

    * A new consensus algorithm
    * A full smart contract system

    The proposed consensus system aims to combine the best of classic distributed systems consensus algorithms and proof-of-work. The aim is an open membership system (unlike classic distributed consensus algorithms) but wants better scalability and throughput than proof-of-work blockchains like Bitcoin.

    Stacks blockchain v2 is being written in Rust. You can follow the development here. The new consensus algorithm and the new smart contract system are proposed as Stacks Improvement Proposals (SIPs) and can be found as SIP-001 38 and SIP-002 27.

    This workshop includes the following:
    * Setup Blockstack Chain V2 with Rust
    * Build a Decentralized app 
    * Run your Dapp
