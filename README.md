# The RustCon Asia website

This repo houses the assets used to build the [RustCon Asia](rustcon.asia) website available at [https://rustcon.asia](https://rustcon.asia).

## Publishing

The site is published automatically by [Netlify](https://netlify.com) whenever changes are pushed to the `master` branch. You do not need to manually publish or manage the site deployment.

## Running the site locally

To run the site locally, you'll need to install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) (in particular the [extended](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) version).


## Adding blog posts

To add a new blog post, add a Markdown file to the `content/blog` folder. There's currently a `first-post.md` file in that directory that can serve as a template.
